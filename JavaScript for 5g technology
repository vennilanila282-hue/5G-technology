Creating a JavaScript application for 5G technology involves working with various aspects such as modulation and coding schemes, channel coding, and more. Here's a basic overview of how you can approach this:

## 5G NR Channel Coding Techniques
- *Polar Codes*: Used for control channels like PBCH, PDCCH, and PUCCH due to their exceptional performance in low-SINR conditions and simplified encoding/decoding processes.
- *LDPC (Low-Density Parity Check) Codes*: Employed for data channels like PDSCH and PUSCH, offering high error correction capability and efficient performance for large block sizes ¹ ².

## Modulation Schemes in 5G NR
- *QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying)*: Transmits 2 bits per symbol, suitable for scenarios with moderate signal quality.
- *16-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)*: Transmits 4 bits per symbol, balancing data rates and robustness.
- *64-QAM*: Transmits 6 bits per symbol, ideal for environments with strong signal conditions.
- *256-QAM*: Transmits 8 bits per symbol, maximizing throughput in high-SINR scenarios ³ ².

## Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC)
- Dynamically adjusts the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) based on real-time channel conditions to maintain optimal performance.
- Ensures efficient use of time-frequency resources in the grid, supporting both high-priority and best-effort traffic.

## JavaScript Implementation
While JavaScript isn't typically used for low-level 5G network implementation, you can create simulations or applications that demonstrate 5G concepts. For example, you can use JavaScript libraries like `mathjs` for mathematical operations and `plotly` for visualizing modulation schemes.

Here's a simple example of how you might simulate QPSK modulation in JavaScript:
function qpskModulation(bits) {
  const symbols = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < bits.length; i += 2) {
    const symbol = Math.cos((bits[i] * Math.PI) / 2) + Math.sin((bits[i + 1] * Math.PI) / 2) * 1j;
    symbols.push(symbol);
  }
  return symbols;
}

// Example usage
const bits = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1];
const symbols = qpskModulation(bits);
console.log(symbols);
This code snippet demonstrates a basic QPSK modulation simulation, where each pair of bits is mapped to a symbol ².
